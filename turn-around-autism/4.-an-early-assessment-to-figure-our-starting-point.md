# 4. An Early Assessment to figure our starting point

* You have to start working with your child not based on his chronological age, but on where he actually is in his development.
* Manding is a term that means “to make a request.
* Tacting is another term coined by Skinner, which refers to labeling.
* Echoing is an imitation skill,
* Intraverbals refer to the ability to answer questions or fill in blanks to songs or phrases.
* Assess your child’s ability to comprehend language without any prompts. Does he respond to his name, for example? If so, how often? Is he able to follow simple directions such as asking him to stand up or clap his hands without a demonstration of the action from you? Will he touch his body parts if you ask without showing him? A good way to make sure you assess receptive language correctly is to sit on your hands while you say, “Touch nose,” or “Get your coat.”
* Imitation is one of the most important skills to assess, as typically developing children learn most language and social skills through imitation. Can your child copy what you do when you ask, such as roll a car back and forth after you show him? If you clap your hands and say “do this,” will he also clap? Does your child copy you or his siblings spontaneously?
* Can your child match identical objects to objects, pictures to pictures, and pictures to objects?
